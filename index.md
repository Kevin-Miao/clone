My name is Gabriel Lipkowitz. I am currently a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University advised by Joseph DeSimone and Eric Shaqfeh. My research focuses on combining novel additive manufacturing processes and generative design methodologies. If you'd like to read about my most recent work, feel free to read about the recently introduced injection continuous liquid interface production (iCLIP) method below.
