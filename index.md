My name is Gabriel Lipkowitz. I am currently a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University advised by [Eric Shaqfeh](https://cheme.stanford.edu/people/eric-shaqfeh) and [Joseph DeSimone](https://profiles.stanford.edu/joseph-desimone). My research focuses on combining novel additive manufacturing processes and generative design methodologies. If you'd like to learn more about my most recent work, feel free to read about the recently introduced injection continuous liquid interface production (iCLIP) method below.
