       <p>The foundational Building Information Modeling course introduces techniques for creating, managing, and applying of building information models in the building design and construction process. The course covers processes and tools for creating, organizing, and working with 2D and 3D computer representations of building components and geometries to produce models used in architectural design, construction planning and documentation, rendering and visualization, simulation, and analysis.

       <p>This course explores tools and techniques for computational design and parametric modeling as a foundation for design optimization. Class sessions will introduce several parametric design modeling platforms and scripting environments that enable rapid generation of 3D models and enable rapid evaluation of parametrically-driven design alternatives. Topics to be featured include: Principles of parametric design vs. direct modelingn, Design exploration using parametric modeling platforms (Revit/FormIt, Rhino), Visual scripting languages and environments (Dynamo, Grasshopper, DesignScript), Single- and multi-dimensional optimization techniques and guidance strategies.
